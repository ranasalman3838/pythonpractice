# 9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant . The __init__() method for
# Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type .
# Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
# information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
# cating that the restaurant is open.
# Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
# butes individually, and then call both methods.

#
# r = Restaurant('onecup','chinese')
# print(f'{r.restaurant_name}')
# r.describe_restaurant()
# r.open_restaurant()


# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User . Create two attributes called first_name
# and last_name , and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
# in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
# of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
# a personalized greeting to the user.
# Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
# for each user.
