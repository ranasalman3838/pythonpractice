# 8-6. City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name
# of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:
# "Santiago, Chile"
# Call your function with at least three city-country pairs, and print the
# values that are returned.

# def city_country(city, country):
#     f = f"{city.title()},{country.title()}"
#     return f
#
#
# formatedoutput = city_country('Islamabad', 'Pakistan')
# print(formatedoutput)


# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
# album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
# information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
# albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the
# album information correctly.
# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to
# store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value for
# the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least
